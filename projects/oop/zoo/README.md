### Instructions
Using OOP, write a tool to store information on animals belonging to a zoo. Consider these things:
* If you were a zoo keeper, what software would make your job easier?
* I want you to build this software with the mindset that you will sell it to all zoos
* scope your project to a day's worth of work. If you didn't scope your project, this project could go for years
