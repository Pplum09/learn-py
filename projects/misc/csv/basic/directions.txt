Scenario:
You are a teacher and you are at the end of the semester. It is time for you to submit grades
for you students! if they average more than a 78%, then they graduate! The only problem is that
you have 1000 students and to do all of this math by hand would take forever. Luckily, you 
thought ahead and documentated all of the grades in a csv file. You've decided to write a program
that parses out the data from the csv file and prints out the averages of the students and if they
are eligible for a diploma.

Directions:
	- Learn what two dimensional lists are
	- write a program to ingest the student grades from the file, print out the averages per student, and if they are eligible to graduate
	- once you are done with your program, open a pull request to the repo and ping Izzy when you're done

Hints, Dos, & Don'ts:
	- In your program, read in the CSV file just as you would any other file, and store data in a 2d List
	- You are able to use built in python methods for this one, but NOT an external csv parsing module
	- Don't use a python module that parses out csv for you. I want you to do this manually
